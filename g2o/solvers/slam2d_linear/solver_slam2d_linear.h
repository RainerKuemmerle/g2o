 * \brief Implementation of a linear approximation for 2D pose graph SLAM
 *
 * Needs to operate on the full graph, whereas the nodes connected by
 * odometry are 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...
 * Furthermore exactly one node should be the fixed vertex.
 * Within the first iteration the orientation of the nodes is computed. In
 * the subsequent iterations full non-linear GN is carried out.
 * The linear approximation is correct, if the covariance of the constraints
 * is a diagonal matrix.
 *
 * More or less the solver is an implementation of the approach described
 * by Carlone et al, RSS'11.
